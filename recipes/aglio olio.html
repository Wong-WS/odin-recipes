        <h2>A classic and simple dish that I enjoyed at one of my local restaurant</h2>

        <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. 
            The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, 
            you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter.
        </p>

        <p>My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti </strong>:This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti.                             </li>
            <li><strong>Oil       </strong>:You'll need Â½ cup of olive oil.                                                                                        </li>
            <li><strong>Garlic    </strong>:Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor.                                                                  </li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>:This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.   </li>
            <li><strong>Cheese    </strong>:For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
        </ul>
